# lawful-access (aka: global backdoor)
#
# Requirement: 
# Some experiments need to involve multiple hosts which need to be orchestrated via ssh. 
# If they experiments are long-running, the orchestration should happen on a control-server in close proximity to the experiment hosts. 
# Solution: 
# We assume christina to be a trusted host. 
# We place an private ssh key on christina which is added as an authorized key to all users on all hosts. 
# Additionally we should filter this key from giving access to the ssh jumphost.
# Note:
# Since functions cannot be exposed to other nixos modules via config options, modules have to import the "apply" function from a seperate file.
